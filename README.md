Simple Discord typescript module to communicate with the Discord API, web interface and database coming soon, submit **issues** for any features you would like to see in coming releases. [https://deno.land/x/discordts](https://deno.land/x/discordts) coming as soon as I get the module working fully and can submit the needed info to deno_land to add this to their database.
